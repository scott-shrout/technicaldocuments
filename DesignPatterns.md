# Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are re-usable "templates" for design that can be used across a variety of applications for addressing common programming needs.

## Creational Design Patterns

**Creational design patterns** are used when addressing the need to construct object instances.

Common design patterns include the following:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Common Use(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Reference(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Singleton         | A design pattern that ensures a single instance of an object is created and used across the application.                                                                                                           | 1.) When a class in your application should have just a single instance available globally (e.g., configuration values, HttpClient, other thread-safe shared dependencies). <br> 2.) When one needs greater control over the use of shared variables.                                                                                | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/python/example)                             |
| Builder           | A design pattern in which the construction of a complex object is separated from its representation. This allows for the product type to be leaner without containing all of the logic needed to construct itself. | 1.) When one needs to eliminate a constructor with a large number of overloads due to potential parameter variations, also known as a _telescoping constructor_. <br> 2.) When there is a need to allow for multiple different representations of some product. <br> 3.) When constructing Composite trees or other complex objects. | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/python/example)                                   |
| Factory           | A design pattern in which a factory class can return objects of different types (all of which implement a specific interface) based upon the inputs to the factory's creation method.                              | 1.) When the exact types and dependencies of required objects is not known at compile time. 2.) When one needs to provide users of a library or framework with a way to extend internal components. <br> 3.) When one needs to reuse existing (often expensive to create) objects instead of rebuilding new ones.                    | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory/python/example)                                     |
| Abstract Factory  | A design pattern that extends the factory pattern such that the factory itself is abstracted, allowing for different factory implementations that all implement a common interface.                                | 1.) When there is a need to interact with various families of related products, but do not want to rely on the concrete classes of those products. <br> 2.) When one has a class with a set of factory methods that blur its primary responsibility.                                                                                 | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory/python/example) |
| Prototype (Clone) | A design pattern in which objects implement an interface that allows for a copy (clone) of the object to be created.                                                                                               | 1.) When there is a need to copy an object and your code doesn't depend on their concrete classes. <br> 2.) When one wants to reduce the number of subclasses that differ only in how they initialize objects.                                                                                                                       | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype/python/example)                             |

## Behavioral Design Patterns

**Behavioral design patterns** are used to address how objects operate and interact with one another.

| Chain of responsibility | A design pattern in which a request is passed along a chain of handlers, each of which determines whether to handle the request or pass it along the chain.                                                                                          | 1.) When an application is expected to process different kinds of requests in different ways, but the exact types of requests and sequences are unknown beforehand. <br> 2.) When it is necessary to execute several handlers in a specific order. <br> 3.) When the order in which handlers are executed is expected to change at runtime.                                                                                                                               | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/python/example) |
| Command                 | A design pattern in which a request is contained in an object that contains all necessary information for completing the request, allowing it to be passed as a method argument, queued, or to support reversible operations.                        | 1.) When one needs to parameterize objects with operations. <br> 2.) When one needs to queue operations, schedule execution, or execute operations remotely. <br> 3.) When one needs to implement reversible operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command/python/example)                                                                 |
| Iterator                | A design pattern in which an abstract collection can return an iterator object that allows for traversing the collection without knowledge of the underlying data structure (e.g. array, linked list, etc.).                                         | 1.) When a collection has a complex internal structure that should be hidden from clients. <br> 2.) When one needs to reduce duplication of collection traversal code across an application. <br> 3.) When there is a need to traverse different data structures or when the types of the structures are not known at compile time.                                                                                                                                       | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator/python/example)                                                             |
| Mediator                | A design pattern in which a mediator object is used to eliminate direct communication among other objects, enabling loose coupling and resulting ability to re-use.                                                                                  | 1.) When changing a class is difficult due to tight coupling among the class and other classes. <br> 2.) When a component in an application can't be re-used because of too many dependencies. <br> 3.) When a large number of component subclasses are being used just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.                                                                                                                                                 | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator/python/example)                                                             |
| Memento (Snapshot)      | A design pattern in which the state of an object can be captured at a point in time, allowing for later restoration, without revealing the details of its implementation.                                                                            | 1.) When an object's state needs to be captured at a specific point in time in order to allow for restoration of the state. <br> 2.) When direct access to an object's members violates its encapsulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento/python/example)                                                                 |
| Observer                | A design pattern in which objects can subscribe to be notified upon the occurrence of an event, typically by invocation of a handler method. This allows for loose coupling among the publisher and subscribers.                                     | 1.) When the change of state of one object may require changes to other objects, and the set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically. <br> 2.) When objects in an application need to observe others for a limited time or in specific cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/python/example)                                                             |
| State                   | A design pattern in which an object can change its behavior by modifying its internal state through use of an abstracted state object.                                                                                                               | 1.) When an object behaves differently based on its current state, has a large number of states, and the state-specific code is often changed. <br> 2.) When a class has a high number of large conditional statements that alter the behavior of the class based on state values. <br> 3.) When there is significant duplication of code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.                                                       | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/python/example)                                                                         |
| Strategy                | A design pattern in which a set of algorithms is encapsulated and can be used interchangeably, allowing for the algorithm to be separated from the client objects that use it.                                                                       | 1.) When one needs to use different variations of a common algorithm and needs to be able to switch at runtime. <br> 2.) When a solution has many similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior. <br> 3.) When isolating the business logic of a class from complex algorithm implementation details. <br> 4.) When a class has a significantly large conditional statement that is used to switch between different variations of an algorithm. | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy/python/example)                                                             |
| Template                | A design pattern in which a superclass defines the template for an algorithm but allows subclasses to override specific steps to alter the behavior without changing the overall structure.                                                          | 1.) When one needs to let clients extend only specific steps of an algorithm, but not the entire structure. <br> 2.) When several classes share significant aspects of an algorithm with only minor variances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [General](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template) <br> Language Specific:<br>[C#](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template/csharp/example)<br>[Java](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template/java/example)<br>[Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template/python/example)                                                             |
| Visitor                 | A design pattern in which an object is modified by passing an instance of a class that implements a specific interface (referred to as a visitor) to it. The visitor object acts upon the object to which it is passed in order to modify its state. | 1.) When one needs to perform an operation of all elements of a complex object structure. <br> 2.)
